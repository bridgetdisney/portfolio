  <p class="indent">I am a PhD student at the University of Missouri’s School of Information
  Science and Educational Technology. I hold a Master of Arts degree in
  Library and Information Science from the University of Missouri plus a BS/BA
  in Computer Science and French from the University of Nebraska. I have worked on <thead>
  </thead> Digital Humanities website at the University of Missouri
  (http://dhc.missouri.edu), and interned at the Center for Digital Research
  in the Humanities at the University of Nebraska. I have also been an instructor for
  a technology class (ISLT 2467: Inquiry into Empowering Learners with Technology) offered
  in the College of Education. Before returning to school for my
  library science degree, I worked as a software engineer at Northrop Grumman Corporation for 14 years.
Bridget’s varied research interests stem from the belief that the field of library and information science has a lot to contribute to the application of data science in the academic and real world. These areas include data visualization and analytics, metadata and APIs, searching for datasets, digital humanities, and data science education for librarians.
