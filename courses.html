    <h4>ISLT 9411: Design/Analysis of Research in ISLT</h4>
    <div class="courses">
      <img class="photoimg" src="images/research.jpg" height="25%">
      <p>
      This course walked us through the process of creating a research paper or proposal. I chose
      to write a proposal to study how refugees could facilitate the exchange of technological
      information among themselves using sociocultural theory postulated by Lev Vygotsky including
      cultural mediation and the zone of proximity. The aim was
      to study how the interpersonal interactions of refugess could ameliorate their situation.
      </p><p>
      Two things really surprised me while researching this paper. The first being the scope of
      the refugee problem in the world (over 60 million refugees!), and the second being how much
      information technology is valued. It was presented as a necessary commodity on par with food and
      shelter.
      </p>
    </div>
    <h4>ISLT 9411: Human Information Behavior</h4>
    <div class="courses">
      <img class="photoimg" src="images/infoseek.png" height="25%">
      <p>
      In this class we worked as a group to flesh out the practices and theories of information
      seeking behavior. We each had to present on a topic and guide a class discusson on relevant
      papers. My topic was on information needs, motivations, and use. The authors of one of the articles
       we discussed (Spink and Cole, 2006) conceptualized how humans have sought information, including
      (a) the everyday life information seeking–sense-making approach,
      (b) the information foraging approach, and
      (c) the problem–solution perspective on information seeking approach.
      </p>
      <p>
      These ideas provided background for later in the class when we tried to map out the theories
      of information behavior and apply them to our own research. This is where I began to tackle
      the problem of how people search for datasets through data discovery. I started out with a
      foraging theory but eventually switched to an examination of archival intelligence.

    <h4>ISLT 9411: Human Computer Interaction</h4>
    <div class="courses">
      <img class="photoimg" src="images/hci.jpg" height="15%">
      <p>This course covered the multidisciplined topic of human computer interaction. We evaluated systems
      design from a theoretical and usability perspective, studying concepts such as cognitive load, working
      memory, and short/long term memory. An example that we examined in depth was the
      ticketing machine to use the subway in Washington, D.C. It was interesting to see how that system
      was helpful and hindering to visiting and long term patrons.
      </p>
      <p>
      This lead me to collaborate with a fellow student on a paper that considered why people choose
      one social media platform over another. We conducted open ended interviews with twelve people and
      analyzed the results. It was my first experience with qualitative research and what impressed me
      the most was the amount of work that is required to process in-person data.

    <h4>AG_ED_LD 8540: Qualitative Research</h4>
    <div class="courses">
      <p>
        I took this course through the Agricultural Education department because I wanted a class that
        was online. It was interesting to see qualitative research from this perspective. During the course,
        I revisited the
        previous paper I had done on social media, presenting it as a case study rather than
        through a phenomenological lens. For a theory, I used &apos;uses and gratification&apos; instead of situated action
        and activity theories. Two additional interviews were conducted for this project.
      </p>
    </div>
    <h4>ESC_PC 8850: Quantitative Foundations</h4>
    <div class="courses">
      <p>
        This course was a follow up to the basic statistics class covering methods such as linear regression and ANOVA
        The theories were addresssed then we implemented them using the "R" programming language.
      </p>
    </div>
      <h4>ESC_PC 8860: Statistical Data Management and Analysis</h4>
      <div class="courses">
        <p>
        The focus for this course was data analysis using the "R" programming language. We concentrated on data
        manipulation and the capabilities of the language and its packages.
      </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    These are courses in data science taken from the MSCS program at the University of Illinois.
    <div id="coursesminor">
      <h4>CS 410: Text Information Systems</h4>
      <div class="courses">
      <p>
        I was particularly interested in this course and found it to helpful in my understanding of programmatic
        text analysis. We discussed many topics including parts of speech tagging, PageRank algorithm (used by Google
        search), and entropy. It also aided my understanding of the factors that influence text analysis like the term
        frequency - inverse document frequency (TF-IDF).
      </p>
      </div>
      <h4>CS 412: Introduction to Data Mining</h4>
      <div class="courses">
        <p>
        This was a challenging course that covered data mining topics incuding pattern discovery, categorization and
        cluster analysis. There are numerous methods for doing this for text and graph based data. It helped me
        become aware of techniques used and gave me experience in implementing some of these methods in Python.
      </p>
      </div>
      <h4>CS 498: Data Visualization</h4>
      <div class="courses">
        <p>
        This was a really fun course that covered the inner workings of Tableau and then introduced the JavaScript
        D3 library. I was excited to strengthen my JavaScript skills. The principles of the course overlapped with my 9411 doctoral seminar in HCI and stressed the
        importance of the user interface.

      <h4>ISLT 9409: Seminar in Digital Libraries</h4>
      <div class="courses">
        <p>
        This course was all about digital capabilities in libraries, covering digitization and file formats. We
        gained some experience harvesting metadata through Washington University and made recommendations for the
        Cambio Center web site at the University of Missouri.
        </p>
      </div>
      <h4>ISLT 9410: Seminar in Emerging Technologies</h4>
      <div class="courses">
        <p>
        This course stands out for me because it's where I first started using Twitter extensively. It also
        encouraged me to try new things.
        </p>
      </div>
      <h4>ISLT 9410: Seminar in Digital Humanities</h4>
      <div class="courses">
        <p>
        Exploring the possibilities of the digital humanities was interesting and opened new doors for me. This
        course was mostly reading but I later did an intership at the Center for Research in the Digital
        Humanties (<a href="https://cdrh.unl.edu" target="_blank">CRDH</a>) at the University of Nebraska working
        on the Lewis and Clark data.
        </p>
      </div>
      <h4>ISLT 9410: Seminar in Geographic Information Systems</h4>
      <div class="courses">
        <p>
        This course gave me practice displaying data through maps. The theme for the class was "book deserts"
        and gave me an understanding of how location can affect the access and choices we have for information.
        </p>
      </div>
      <h4>ISLT 9443: The Academic Library</h4>
      <div class="courses">
        <p>
        Since I'm interested in working in academia, I was glad to learn about the academic library. This course
        gave me insight into no only how the college library works, but also how it fits into the whole
        university system.
        </p>
      </div>
      <h4>ISLT 9446: International & Comparative Librarianship</h4>
      <div class="courses">
        <p>
        I have always been interested in other countries and languages. This course gave me the opportunity to
        research other countries that I was interested in, two of which were Slovenia (my ancestry) and
        Mongolia. I  had a friend living in Mogolia at the time and was able to ask her about the libraries
        there. The interesting thing about Mongolia is that many areas are remote and yet the people have found
        ways to get remote access through books and technology.
        </p>
      </div>
      <h4>ISLT 9432: Online Searching</h4>
      <div class="courses">
        <p>
        This course was so much fun because we got search for topics in different databases. It introduced me to
        the concepts of precision and recall which were re-addressed in my text analysis class.
        </p>
      </div>
      <h4>ISLT 9440: Learning with the Internet</h4>
      <div class="courses">
        <p>
        This was one of the few courses I have taken that covered learning design. We learned the fundamentals of
        meaningful learning and how to incorporate technology into our class lessons. Coming from the library and
        information science background, this was new territory for me. The basics of this course really
        helped me a year later when I was teaching "Technology to Enhance Learning" (ISLT 4467).
        </p>
      </div>
      <h4>ISLT 9454: Copyright</h4>
      <div class="courses">
        <p>
        Even though this course was totally outside of what I was accustomed to, I knew this was an important
        class to take in the library and educational world. It's a complicated subject and I can't say that I
        remember all the rules but it made me aware of copyright and what needs to be considered.
        </p>
      </div>
      <h4>ISLT 9466: Learning Analytics</h4>
      <div class="courses">
        <p>
        In this course, we delved into educational data and visualization from a teacher's point of view. We
        examined what data shows evidence of learning and improvement.
        </p>
      </div>
      <h4>ISLT 7356: Interactive Web Design with JavaScript</h4>
      <div class="courses">
        <p>
        I was already familiar with JavaScript but I took this course because it focused on jQuery, a
        JavaScript library that I was unfamiliar with. It allowed me to use more features and become more
        comfortable with this langugage.
        </p>
      </div>
      <h4>ISLT 7375: Mobile Web App Development</h4>
      <div class="courses">
        <p>
        Again, more JavaScript libraries to expand my knowledge. Developing mobile applications was just
        something I wanted to learn but had never taken the time.
        </p>
      </div>
      <h4>ISLT 7410: Seminar in Gaming</h4>
      <div class="courses">
        <p>
        I'm not really a "gaming" person, but this course opened my eyes to the many learning possibilities
        that gaming provides. We played games, developed a "game" plan for learning, and finally created
        our own game using a tool called Stencyl. There is so much more that can be done with this, so it
        gave me good start.
